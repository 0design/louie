    <p>Have you ever picked a username online, only to realise ‘animefan’ is already taken on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and Tumblr? Have you stared in despair at the sign up screen as it tells you you can have animal_fan instead? Yeah, me too. It's the quintessential modern problem. And this right here is a solution.

    <p>This project was the result of an afternoon spent with my friend <a href="https://github.com/manu-chroma">Manvendra</a> trying to learn Python. We used <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org">Flask</a>, a python framework, to create an API which checks if a username exists on a website. It’s all very clever, and you can read more about it on the <a href="https://github.com/manu-chroma/username-availability-checker">project page on Github</a>.
