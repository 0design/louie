<p>I’ve been working as a freelance designer for a while now, and I’ve worked with a number of individuals and organizations — mostly startups. This has been a constant learning experience — in the past two years I’ve done branding work, made print posters and magazines, created illustrations and infographics, designed and coded websites, worked on interface design for mobile apps, and conducted user research — mostly because I end up being a design team of one. I’ve enjoyed the freedom this has afforded me to do things my way, but I’ve also always wanted to work with other designers, and I’d been looking for a chance to work as part of a design team for a while.

<p>In November 2016, I went for a <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/3042330-Product-before-Pixels">Product Thinking workshop</a> organized by the Zomato design team. After a pretty interesting talk, I talked to the team over pizza, and asked them about the possibility of interning with Zomato in the winter. I sent over my portfolio, interviewed with them a few days later, and started work as an intern on the Product Design team in December 2016.

      <div class="blogtitle2">What I've learnt</div>

<p><b>1) Do your research.</b><p>
With a lot of projects, I’ve made design decisions by trying to put myself in the user’s shoes — because I had no actual data to go on. Empathising with the user is important, but it’s not a substitute for actual user research. The first time I went out into the field to conduct research, I was blown away by how many of my assumptions about the users were wrong.

<p><b>2) Start on paper.</b><p>
I’d been using Sketch so much for so long that I’d started feeling like it’s faster for me to design directly in Sketch. Sketch definitely is really really quick once you learn it, but sketching on paper first lets you think of the why behind design decisions before jumping into detailing each pixel. Regardless of how efficient your digital flow is, it hurts a lot less to discard bad ideas when they’re just squiggles on paper. If I could go back and do one thing differently, I’d plan out the entire app on paper before I moved to a screen — I’ve wasted a lot of time making changes to pixel perfect screens where I had to move everything else around to accommodate an idea I just had. 
<p><b>3) Validate with users.</b><p>
The worst parts of your design can be hard to identify, since you made it and everything makes sense to you. User research can be as simple as showing your app or prototype to someone and asking them to enact a given scenario — and telling them to talk about what they are thinking.
<p><b>4) Write it down. </b><p>
When I started my internship, I noticed that everyone had notebooks in which they wrote down any feedback they got, or any ideas they had. I’ve mostly trusted my brain to remember things (and then utterly forgotten) or used digital notes, but I’ve started maintaining a notebook and it’s been surprisingly useful.
