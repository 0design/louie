        <p>One day as I was on Dribbble, I stumbled upon their meetups section. I realised there hadn't been one in Delhi, so I decided to organise one.

<p>We had 14 designers from various fields talk about their experiences with design, their processes, as well as tips theyâ€™ve picked up over the years.

      <div class="imgdesc">This looks interesting.</div>
      <p>Since this went pretty well, I plan on organising more designer meetups like this one. Join the Delhi Designers <a href="https://github.com/manu-chroma">Facebook group</a> to get updates about any future events</a>.
