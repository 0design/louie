  <p>The MOVA1 logo had to represent the structure and minimalism of the brand. This was achieved by using custom type, based on the Arial letterforms.
    <p>The color scheme was chosen to be as sparse as possible - black and a light grey, with a salmon color used sparingly as an accent.

<div class="blogtitle2">Website</div>


<p>The MOVA1 website acts as a portfolio for the work the firm has done, and also has details about ongoing projects in the live section. The layout was done in accordance with the same principles of structure and minimalism - the red lines run across the page on load, and give the website a unique, wholesome appearance.    </p><center><img src="/assets/img/movasite.png"></center>
