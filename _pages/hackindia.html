    <div class="blogtitle2">About HackIndia</div>
    <p>HackIndia was India's first large scale hackathon for students, organised by students. It brought together India's makers, designers, hackers and creators for a weekend of building cool things.

        <div class="blogtitle2">Branding</div>
<p>As India's first student organised hackathon, the focus for the branding was the saffron and green from the Indian flag. The HackIndia wordmark also featured a flag over the i, which formed the centerpiece of the branding.

      <div class="blogtitle2">Social media campaigns</div>
      <p>HackIndia took place at a time when hackathons were only just starting to catch on in India, and there were still a lot of negative connotations associated with "hacking". As a result, the branding was designed to look as friendly as possible, and a lot of effort was put into making people aware of the concept of hackathons.

<div class="blogtitle2">The Event</div>
<p>At HackIndia 2015, we brought together some of the nationâ€™s best artists, designers, creators, inventors and leaders of tomorrow. It was a pretty successful event (some organisational mishaps aside) and everyone took away a lot from the event.
